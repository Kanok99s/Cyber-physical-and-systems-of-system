### Team mission: 
Our mission is to work together as a unified team and be able to successfully complete our assignments on time with the best outcomes. We aim to work hard all together as a team and develop a strong sense of problem solving, and productivity. 

### Aims
- Finishing the course. 
- Grade: 5. 

### Collaboration plan
- #### _Tools:_ 
    - Gitlab to share code and collaborate 
    - Trello-board for task management 
    - Microsoft OneDrive for documentation 
    - VS Code for code conducting 
    - Zoom for meeting  
    - Discord as main communication channel
----
- To organize our work, we plan on using Scrum. Each sprint will be 2 weeks long. We will have sprint planning, sprint reviews, sprint retrospectives every other Monday, we will also elect a new product owner and scrum master. Daily Stand-ups will be conducted on zoom. 


- During sprint planning we will decide on the sprint backlog. The items in the sprint backlog will be divided amongst the team members. When someone starts working on a task, the item should be moved from the “sprint backlog” column to the “doing” column. Once they are done, they will move it to the “review” column where it will be reviewed and approved by the scrum master and product owner before it is moved to the “Done” list. 

- We will apply pair programming on the more complicated tasks. For the individual assignments, we will help each other if needed or in case someone has any issues, and make sure everyone is on track.  

 

### Team learning and knowledge synchronisation 

- By engaging in scrum practices, members will give updates on their status and latest work. Every group member will be able to stay informed by checking the team’s one drive and Trello as a collaboration tool. The code commits on git will keep all members updated on individual contributions. The daily stand-up sessions and meetings twice (monday and thursday) will help ensure knowledge transfer among our team members. 

 
### Meetings Attendance 

- Attending the group meetings is an individual responsibility and all members are expected to attend unless for a good reason (i.e. illness, transport delays, family matters) which must be communicated in a timely manner. 

- What project members expect from one another regarding attendance to meetings: 
    - Be on time. Otherwise, contact the team members at least 30 minutes before the meeting starts. 

- A total attendance of 3 members and above is needed to start a meeting or make any decision affecting the project or the team. 

### Communication 

- For in-person meetings, we intend to mainly use it for synchronisation of the project, help other members to fix their issues if there are any(pair programming), and other things that we deem necessary and requrie all members to be present(i.e. prepare for presentation, etc).
- For online meeting, we intend to use it for daily stand-ups, quick discussions that are urgent and discusing minor obstacles(if it can't be solved then we can arrage for an in-person meeting to discuss it together)

- Via Discord, Zoom, or physically, in case of emergency via phone.  

- How often?- Whenever needed on Discord 

- Communication via Discord? 

- Having discussions regarding the time and location of the meetings 
- Sharing resources
- Daily updates of individual progress
- Discussing minor obstacles 
- Using voice channel of discord for urgent meetings 


- Daily stand-ups on Wednesdays, Tuesday and Friday via Zoom.

- Long Meeting twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays on-site and online.

### Participation in Project work 

 
- All members should be committed and feel responsible for the project's progress and have full awareness of his/her individual responsibilities. 

- We agree to help each other and show interest in the work. We are expected to be open about our mistakes, errors, and approaches to a specific problem. Be involved and up to date in the project. In case something is difficult, reach out to team members or schedule a meeting with TA or Teacher.  

- From a leadership perspective, we agree to work towards a working environment where every opinion is valued and each idea considered. We will do so while upholding a respectful, honest and professional tone at all times. A healthy and positive working environment will both stimulate our creativity and effectiveness. By signing this contract, we agree to work towards and uphold such an environment. Our team leadership should be a joint effort from all team members.  

 
### Conflicts management 

- We will have a respectful and inclusive atmosphere to avoid personal conflicts. If there happens to be a conflict the project owner should be notified by either of the parties involved. He/she will try to resolve the conflict with the help of the other team members by promoting fluid communication. In case nothing works out well or as expected, the project owner will inform the team TA before taking any other action. 

- We plan to have open communication and transparency in the team. The group should encourage collaboration. Every member should have the opportunity to express their ideas without fear of judgement 

- On issues regarding working processes or how to approach something, we will vote on the approach to take. We will strive toward consensus however if it cannot be achieved, decisions will be made with a majority vote.
